MySQL does not support FULL JOIN directly. To achieve a full outer join in MySQL, you can use a combination of LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN with a UNION.

SELECT e.*, c.*
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Customers c ON e.City = c.City

UNION

SELECT e.*, c.*
FROM Employees e
RIGHT JOIN Customers c ON e.City = c.City;
