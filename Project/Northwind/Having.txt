1. Create a report that shows the order ids and the associated employee names for orders that shipped after the required date (37 rows)

select count(*)
from Orders o 
inner join Employees e 
on o.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID 
where o.ShippedDate > o.RequiredDate

select DISTINCT o.EmployeeID, CONCAT(e.FirstName, ' ', e.LastName) as name  
from Orders o 
inner join Employees e 
on o.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID 
where o.ShippedDate > o.RequiredDate

2. Create a report that shows the total quantity of products (from the Order_Details table) ordered. Only show records for products for which the quantity ordered is fewer than 200 (5rows)
select count(*) from `Order Details` as od WHERE Quantity < 200;

3. Create a report that shows the total number of orders by Customer since December 31,1996. The report should only return rows for which the total number of orders is greater than 15 (5 rows)

select c.CustomerID, COUNT(o.OrderID) as Total_order_placed
from Customers c 
inner join Orders o 
on c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID 
where o.OrderDate > '1996-12-31'
group by CustomerID
having Total_order_placed > 15


Where -> Group By -> Having -> Orders By
